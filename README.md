# MiniWads
A bunch of little GZDoom/Zandronum-compatible WADS that test out some of my ideas and proofs of concepts.

## fastmenu
A quick menu system that should show important info without hindering player actions/etc. 
This should essentially be the scoreboard but ideally be extensible and modular.
